* fix linebreak before schemedisplay
* fix undefined references
* list of methods under class doesn't seem to show the ones we inherit?
* group methods according to use
    - notification methods:  key-press key-release configure ...  scroll notify stuff?
    - attribute stuff
       - subdivision here?
    - cursor movement / etc.
* merge class lists under method when duplicate documentation (see init method for example)
- seem to be getting extra \noindents which screw up indentation
- first line of schemedisplay'd examples in tutorial HTML code is badly spaced
- documentation for init method is screwy

- method documentation in some places is identical (or close) and should be
  inherited (or merge with cases that have duplicate documentation).
- first line of documentation for each method is indented just a few points.
    \noindent problem?

- SWL documentation
   - labels in href aren't coming out right
     (getting numbers instead of text used as key for \ref anything useful)
   - just need to do classes and methods now...
   - where we describe the <foo> class or the bar method, it might be cool
     to have it insert a link (at least for HTML version) to the appropriate
     tutorials
   - index from methods back to classes and from classes to methods
   - separate documentation of methods and classes, add as formdefs so
     methods end up in form summary
       - suppress duplicates
       - what to do about set-coords multi-arity guys?
       * structure of reference manual will be
           - tutorials (not sure where these go)
           - macros
           - procedures
           - methods
              - trash the set-! methods of <font>
              - seems like we're going to want generics...
           - classes
   - links from tutorials to documentation?
     (or leave this up to the documentation viewer?)


* changes to hprep and prep
    - \section \chapter, etc. now process the text w/in their { ... }
    * probably should just change defn of read-bracketed-text, but to do that
      we need to have access to s0
    - \def items can now shadow built-in forms recognized by prep / hprep
      (ie. section, etc.)

- currently several problems with class names in html output:
    <menu> means something in HTML
    <font> means something in HTML
    etc.

- problems with macros not being expanded and html conversion
  not being done (ie. > => &gt).

  in body_3.html for example, I can manually replace \mytt{ ... }
  with <code>...</code> and then see that we get the following at
  top of file:

    <h3><a name="sec1">Section</a> 4.1. <code><font></code></h3>

  should be

    <h3><a name="sec1">Section</a> 4.1. <code>&lt;font&gt;</code></h3>
