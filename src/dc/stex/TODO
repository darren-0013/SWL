overall:
  - try setting proper-nesting? to #t in scheme-prep calls to insert-quotes
    along with modified version of makeindex
  - change documentation or implementation of \var; presently,
    only first character after _ is sup'd
  - update ReadMe
    - document operation of independent modules:
      - tspl-prep foo.stex => foo.tex,
          scheme-prep foo.stex => foo.tex
          or index-prep foo.itex => foo.tex
        latex foo.tex => foo.dvi
        html-prep foo.tex => foo.html

tspl:
  - flush/reduce giant book picture
  - consider including note in index & summary re: page numbers
  - consider adding back pointers to cite-points from bib entries

hprep:
  - check conformance of generated html code
  - update documentation
  - use read-arg in place of read-bracketed-text where appropriate
  - add other latex support
  - add \let, \global
  - create local def-env's w/o side effects; eliminate other side effects
  - fix \def pattern matching to follow tex rules
  - fancy up index with headers, quick access links
  - try to handle more subscripts/superscripts in htmlmath
  - replace --- with em-dash, -- with en-dash if available
  - consider adding some color; also hrule (or fancy hrule) before formdefs
  - consider readjusting math size
  - allow comments in math mode
  - have see(foo) in index generate link to index entry for foo
  - convert < and > to tex equivalents outside tt mode?
  - add explicit \begin{latex} ... \end{latex} (punttolatex) environment?
  - add \latexheader, \latextrailer, or \latexinclude commands?
  - expand macros before going off to punt-to-latex?
  - squash out redundant whitespace & pars
    - maintain a "mode" flag: vertical or horizontal.  insert par only when
      encountering two newlines in horizontal mode

cssm:
  - see tspl todo
  - merged tspl/cssm formsummary & index

code.ss:
  - write special-purpose code extractor if code.ss is desired

prim database:
  - extract prim database from sorted-forms.raw
    - produce prim, label pairs from lines in the form:
        \sfentry{\scheme{(prim stuff ...)}{type}{\pageref{label}}
