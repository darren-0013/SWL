# Scheme Widget Library

The Scheme Widget Library (SWL) is no longer being maintained by Indiana University Computer Science Department, National Science Foundation and Cadence Research Systems.  [Source Code](https://www.scheme.com/csv8.4/swl1.3-src.tar.gz)

I upload it in here for the reasons below:

1. Protect its source code lost in the further.

2. Read the source code will help to study the GUI binding and implentation of OOP system in Chez Scheme.

3. Maintaining as much as I can, if I could.


The Scheme Widget Library (SWL) is a windowing and graphics package for Chez Scheme developed in the Indiana University Computer Science Department with support from the National Science Foundation and Cadence Research Systems. It includes an object system for Scheme, a threaded windowing and graphics library, and various tools, including a window-based REPL (read-eval-print loop) window, a simple editor, a source-file viewer, and a document viewer. See the reference manual for more information on the windowing and graphics library.

SWL runs on each of the platforms supported by Chez Scheme: Windows, Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and SunOS, with either Chez Scheme or Petite Chez Scheme. It can be built from sources only by Chez Scheme, since building it requires the compiler. SWL is documented in the [SWL Reference Manual](https://www.scheme.com/swlman/).

SWL is based on [Tcl/Tk](http://www.tcl.tk).
