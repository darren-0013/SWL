<h1>Preface</h1>





<p>
SWL is an object-oriented, multithreaded graphics and windowing library
for Scheme and a set of tools that are being developed using this
library.  These tools include:

<p>
<ul>
<li>a window-based interaction environment, or read-evaluate-print
    loop, with editing capabilities, a powerful history mechanism, and
    a template mechanism to help guide programming exercises for novice
    programmers;

<p>
<li>a simple editor for editing Scheme source files;

<p>
<li>a source-file viewer capable of highlighting matching variable
    bindings and references, procedure call sites, assignable variables,
    and other interesting program characteristics;

<p>
<li>a graphical inspector for Scheme objects, including continuations
    and procedures, with hooks into the source-file viewer;

<p>
<li>a graphical profiler that hooks into the source-file viewer to
    allow programmers to visualize program "hot spots," i.e., portions
    of their programs that are executed most frequently;

<p>
<li>a stepping interpreter; 

<p>
<li>a lecture scripting tool that allows split-screen viewing of
    lecture slides and interactive evaluation of Scheme programs; and

<p>
<li>a simple HTML document viewer.
</ul>

<p>
The development of SWL has been supported by the National Science
Foundation under an educational infrastructure grant and by Cadence
Research Systems (CRS), which develops and distributes Chez Scheme.
SWL's development has been managed by Kent Dybvig in consultation with
Chris Haynes, George Springer, and Dan Friedman.  Oscar Waddell has
taken the lead in designing and implementing the system.
Other contributors to the system's development include Carl
Bruggeman, Bob Burger, Erik Hilsdale, and John Zuckerman.

<p>
SWL is built on top of Chez Scheme extended with support for threads
and object-oriented programming.  The graphics and windowing
capabilities are supported by the Tcl/Tk system, which is made
available via Chez Scheme's foreign procedure interface.  SWL makes
heavy use of the syntax-case macro system and reader (Scheme
source code lexer and parser) that annotates programs with source file
information.
