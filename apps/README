All these things are works in progress.

automata   -  first draft of a tool for editing and running turing machines
common     -  useful library classes shared by the apps (put extensions here)

design     -  an extended editor for structured editing of programs
edit       -  simple text editor
fileview   -  simple file viewer that exploits source-object correlation
graph      -  a simple graph editor that should be abstracted w/ automata
htmlview   -  HTML browser
