* Start this program with
  (vinspect <some scheme object>)
  though you've already done that.
* (vdebug) inspects the last error
  continuation.
* ``File''-Quit destroys the current 
  inspector only.
* ``File''-Spawn spawns off a new
  inspector containing only the 
  currently viewed object.
* The big R button stands for 
  ``refresh''.  It reloads the 
  currently viewed object (in case it
  is side-effected, for example)

"Bugs"

"
* A null embedded in a string will
  confuse string inspection quite 
  a bit.
* The keys are somewhat unintuitive.
* Ruthlessly stealing Netscape's 
  interface
"

;; -------------------------------------
"Features"

" 
* Very few side-effects.
* Using an xy-output-string, which
  keeps info about xy position as well
  as offset.  This needs 
  set-port-output-buffer!, I think.
* Ruthlessly stealing Netscape's 
  interface.
"

;; -------------------------------------
"Todo"

"
* circular structures
* ports
* named taggable objects
* sliders for length and level
* perhaps reorganize the creation of
  inspect-windows so that they
  keep their length and level better,
  as well as keeping their graph-envs
  and fonts (done now with
  parameterize).
