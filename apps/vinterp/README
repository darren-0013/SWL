To use:

This requires a version of Chez Scheme >= 5.0f.

- create a symlink to cmacros.ss from the source distribution of the version
  of Chez Scheme you're using to build SWL
- create a symlink to the modified interpret.ss provided separately
- % swl vinterp.ss
  (this will dump some usage information to the console)
