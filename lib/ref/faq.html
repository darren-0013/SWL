<li><i>Menus seem broken under KDE.</i><br>

  Under KDE 1.0 (1.1 is untested) you may need to click a menubutton twice
  to get the menu to post.  This showed up when we moved from Tcl/Tk 8.0.2
  to Tcl/Tk 8.0.4.  To work around this bug, select one of the following
  focus policies in the KDE window configuration dialog:
  "Classic focus follows mouse" or "Classic sloppy focus".
  <b>Note:</b> this should be fixed now that we've switched to Tk's
  native menu code (for Windows compatibility).
<li><i>File selection dialogs produce strange (Tcl/Tk) errors.</i>
  Some versions of Tcl/Tk prior to 8.0.4 seem to have a bug in the Tcl/Tk
  file dialog code.  If you see an error message like "Error: can't set
  "data(selectPath)": bad window path name ...," upgrading to
  a newer version of Tcl/Tk should fix the problem.
<li><i>Changing <tt>waiter-prompt-and-read</tt> produced unexpected behavior.</i>
  Changing <tt>waiter-prompt-and-read</tt> may interfere with the REPL's
  paren bouncing and indentation mechanisms.
