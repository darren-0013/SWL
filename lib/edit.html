<h1>Editor Help</h1>

Use the editor to create files containing your programs.
The editor has several features that simplify editing of Scheme programs,
including automatic parenthesis highlighting, automatic indentation,
movement by S-expression, and integration with the REPL.
<p>
Just below the menu of the editor is a one-line text area
where the editor normally displays the line and character position
of the cursor.
This area is also used when searching for text within the file
and when displaying the source of syntax errors.

<h3>Common Key Bindings</h3>
The REPL and the Editor share a set of
<a href="keys.html">common key bindings</a>
for cursor movement and editing.  These bindings are described on
a separate page.
<p>

<h3>Key Bindings Specific to the Editor</h3>
<table><tr><th>Key</th><th>Action</th></tr>
<tr><td nowrap>Alt+a</td><td>Save file as...</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap>Alt+s</td><td>Save file</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap>Alt+g</td><td>Save the file and load it into the REPL</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap>Alt+&lt;</td><td>Move to beginning of buffer</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap>Alt+&gt;</td><td>Move to end of buffer</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
MacOS X note: If double-clicking on a Scheme file (extension .ss or .scm)
does not open up a SWL edit window, please follow the steps below:
</p>

<ol>
 <li>In the finder, select a file with the .ss or .scm extension.
 <li>From the finder File menu, select "Open with".
 <li>Even if swl.app is shown as the default, select "Other".
 <li>Locate and single-click swl.app in the Applications folder.
 <li>Enable the check box labeled "Always Open With".
 <li>Click on "Open".
</ol>

<p>
Double-clicking on files with that extensions should now work properly.
You may have to repeat the procedure for files with the other extension,
e.g., .scm if you performed the procedure for a file with the .ss
extension.
You can also arrange to use SWL for files with other extensions using
the same procedure.
